# Employee_performance_and_productivity

## Executive Summary: 
- **Workforce contraction**: Hiring fell sharply (−32%), while resignations also declined, indicating constrained growth rather than improved retention.
- **Compensation anomalies**: Pay and workload are misaligned, with some employees overworked at low pay, and others underworked at high pay.
- **Operational hotspots**: Operations and IT departments dominate salary spend, promotions, and overtime, creating concentration risks.
- **Talent development**: Training correlates strongly with performance, but inexperienced young managers highlight leadership gaps.
- **Strategic priorities**: Address pay equity, rebalance workload, and expand structured training to retain high performers and build sustainable leadership pipelines.



### Goals:
- Performance Distribution and Top/Bottom Performers (rankings based on department, job title, ratings, etc)
- Productivity Metrics: Projects completed per employee, hours worked vs. output (e.g., sales/targets), or productivity score (output/hours). Insight: Who are the most/least productive? Trends in overtime vs. results.
- Correlation Between Factors and Performance/Productivity 




### Key Takeaway:

The company exhibits **structural imbalances**: hiring contraction and reduced resignations mask deeper issues in workload distribution, pay‑for‑performance alignment, and managerial capability; targeted interventions in workforce planning, compensation design, and training will improve productivity and equity.

### Key Insights (2020–2024 Workforce Analysis):
| Metric / Trend | Headline Insight | Implication |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| **−32% hiring (2022→2024)** | Sharp contraction in workforce | Signals cost-cutting or slowed growth; risk of capability gaps |
| **−34.6% resignations (2023→2024)** | Attrition declined despite hiring freeze | Suggests retention measures or limited external opportunities | 
| **4,455 female hires (2022)** | Female hiring peaked post‑COVID | Strong DEI momentum; Operations led with 588 female hires | 
| **Avg satisfaction 3/5** | Engagement flat across stayers/leavers | Satisfaction not predictive of churn; deeper drivers need analysis |
| **Pay vs hours anomalies** | High pay with low hours; low pay with high hours | Compensation misalignment; fairness and productivity concerns |
| **$7.62M salaries (Ops, 2022)** | Operations is cost center | Budget allocation review needed; peak spend in one department | 
| **62 employees with 99 training hrs** | Training linked to top performance | Evidence for scaling structured training programs |
| **1,197 promotions (Ops, 2021)** | Promotions concentrated in Operations | Career progression uneven; risk of morale issues elsewhere |
